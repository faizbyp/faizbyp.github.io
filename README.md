There's a lot to learn about web development. One of them is the **Rendering Paradigm**.

A website is mainly shown with an HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. But making them from scratch will be quite tough. Especially when it comes to a lot of content on the site. **Static Site Generator (SSG)** is a technology to generate sites from a text, mainly wrote in Markdown. **Hugo** is one of the framework to make and generate a static site. So with this repository, I hope I could learn something new about web development, especially in the SSG rendering paradigm.
